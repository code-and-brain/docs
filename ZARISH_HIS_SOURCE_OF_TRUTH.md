## 2. INTEGRATED SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE

ZARISH-HIS is built on the principle of **Interconnected Modules**, where data flows seamlessly between different levels of care.

### 2.1. The EMR-EHR-HIS Linkage

> **EMR (Electronic Medical Record):** The digital version of a patient's chart at a single facility.  
> **EHR (Electronic Health Record):** A longitudinal record of patient health information generated by one or more encounters in any care delivery setting.  
> **HIS (Health Information System):** The aggregate system that manages data for health policy, planning, and management.
